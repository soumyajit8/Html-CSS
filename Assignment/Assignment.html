				1) As the Final Year Project I and other 3 of my teammates did - "Image Cryptography Using Binary RSA Algorithm".
				In which we have taken an image and converted it into a Base-64 text file using Python.
				And then we Encrypted that text file through Binary RSA Algorithm using C.In this process
				Public and Private key is generated . Using the Public Key Sender can encrypt the message and using 
				the Private key User can decrypt the message . Through this our goal was to increase the security
				of transmission . Here actually the encoding is done in two steps -- Firstly, When we apply Base64
				encoding this also creates a text which is not easy to decode . then, we have applied the Binary RSA
				which is a standard,trusted encryption algorithm . So we can say that rather using a direct Encryption 
				technique we have tried to increase the level of security.
